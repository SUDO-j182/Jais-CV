My first Programming Project - 

This CV document was developed entirely from basic HTML elements and simple CSS styling, initially i completed the project on my android mobile phone using the free Acode IDE App (Intergrated Development Enviroment).
Then once the basic styling was complete and the download button made functional, with working links nested in the head section of the document. i uploaded the .html with internal CSS to github pages and the document 
is now live.

Plans on Moving Forward - Having tested the water, i intend to take on several more projects that will increase and eventually solidify my knowledge and skills with HTML and CSS programming. Once confident with the
former languages i will branch into javascript.
